# AWS Infrastructure Automation Using Terraform

This project automates a complete, production-grade, multi-AZ AWS architecture using Terraform, following modular design, clean variable structure, reusable components, and secure AWS best practices.

The infrastructure provisions a Dockerized web application running on private EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), with access controlled through multiple layers of security groups, IAM roles, and a Bastion Host.
